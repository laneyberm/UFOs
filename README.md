# UFO Sightings Webpage with Filter Capabilities

## Overview
Dana's goal was to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. We built two things: the webpage that will allow users to view the data using HTML and a dynamic table that will present it using JavaScript. Additionally, we added table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape. Dana wants an analysis of her website and it's usability.


## Resources
- Data Source: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/4.11.0/d3.js, app.js, data.js
- Software: Javascript 1.5, Bootstrap 4.0, Visual Studio Code 1.72.2 

## Results
The below image is the initial webpage without using the filters. The user can re-itialize the webpage by clicking the "UFO Sightings" at the top of the page.
